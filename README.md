The media queries of max-width did not work either on Android phones/tablets or on iPhone. Because of the deadline I decided to make the responsive desing only for computerr screen at first.
The design spec is not specific enough. In "Start learning" session the 6 topics could be links to subpages, but it is not shown. My project does not handle them as links (neither in <720px version).
